# What is next?

We tried to describe the fundamentals of _Axe API_ until now. After that, you can directly jump into coding. But again, we strongly suggest that you should read the boring [Architecture](/architecture-concepts/analyzing/) parts. Understanding the architecture is the best way to build robust APIs.

Please keep in mind that _Axe API_ is **not** an **MVC framework**. Treating it not like an _MVC framework_ and stretching the boundaries could be a problem. _Axe API_ has a **distinctive** structure that probably you haven't met before.

Good luck with your journey!
