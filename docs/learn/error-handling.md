## Motivation

**Error handling** in REST APIs involves managing and communicating errors that occur during API interactions. It includes providing informative error responses, appropriate HTTP status codes, and error messages to help clients understand and handle errors effectively.

Axe API provides a common error structure for all endpoints that are generated by model definition. It uses HTTP status codes actively. Also, Axe API provides a common response structure for both validation and custom errors.

## HTTP status codes

Axe API provides the following status codes for all **auto-generated routes**;

### `200`

It means that everything is fine and no error was found.

::: code-group

```bash [cURL]
$ curl --head http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users
```

```bash [Response Headers]
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Thu, 18 May 2023 15:34:00 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
```

:::

### `400`

It means that the HTTP client sent unacceptable data. It can be thrown by Axe API directly due to form validation, like the following example;

::: code-group

```bash [cURL]
$ curl --head -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users
```

```bash [Response Headers]
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Thu, 18 May 2023 15:34:00 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
```

```json [Response Body]
{
  "errors": {
    "email": ["The email field is required."],
    "name": ["The name field is required."],
    "surname": ["The surname field is required."]
  }
}
```

:::

On the other hand, in some cases, Axe API might use the `ApiError` class to throw an error message like the following example;

```ts
throw new ApiError(`Unacceptable query parameter: ${value}`);
```

In this case, the error message is returned with both a `400` **HTTP Status Code** and the following response body.

::: code-group

```bash [cURL]
$ curl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users?fields=xxx"
```

```bash [Response Headers]
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Thu, 18 May 2023 15:34:00 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
```

```json [Response Body]
{ "error": "Undefined column names: xxx" }
```

:::

### `404`

It means that the resource is not found on the API.

::: code-group

```bash [cURL]
$ curl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/999"
```

```bash [Response Headers]
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Thu, 18 May 2023 15:34:00 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
```

```json [Response Body]
{ "error": "The item is not found on User." }
```

:::

## Error handler

Axe API provides an error handler in all Axe API projects as default like the following one;

::: code-group

```ts [app/v1/Handlers/ErrorHandler.ts]
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";

const ErrorHandler = (
  err: any,
  req: Request,
  res: Response,
  next: NextFunction
) => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    return res.status(500).send({
      message: "An error occurred!",
    });
  }

  throw err;
};

export default ErrorHandler;
```

:::

You can edit the `ErrorHandler.ts` file by yourself.

Also, you can disable it by removing the following line on the `init.ts` file.

::: code-group

```ts{5} [app/v1/init.ts]
import { Express } from "express";
import ErrorHandler from "./Handlers/ErrorHandler";

const onAfterInit = async (app: Express) => {
  app.use(ErrorHandler);
};

export { onAfterInit };
```

:::

## Custom errors

Axe API provides a standard error message structure to you via the `ApiError` class. You can throw an error in your hooks like the following example;

::: code-group

```ts{4} [../Hooks/User/onBeforePaginate.ts]
import { ApiError, StatusCodes } from "axe-pi";

export default async () => {
  throw new ApiError("My custom error!", StatusCodes.FORBIDDEN)
};
```

```bash [cURL]
$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users
```

```bash [Response Headers]
HTTP/1.1 403 OK
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Thu, 18 May 2023 15:34:00 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
```

```json [Response Body]
{
  "error": "My custom error!"
}
```
