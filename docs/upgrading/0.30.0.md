# Upgrading to 0.30.0

This version contains some major and breaking changes. You can easily upgrade your project by using this documentation.

## Step 1. Serialization Folder

Axe API will not support model `serialize` method anymore with this version.

You should create a `Serialization` folder under the `app` directory instead of that model function.

#### Before

```ts
class User extends Model {
  serialize(item: any, request: Request) {
    return {
      ...item,
      fullname: `${item.name} ${item.surname}`,
    };
  }
}
```

#### After

```ts
class User extends Model {
  // no serialize method anymore
}
```

`app/Serialization/UserSerialization.ts`

```ts
import { Request } from "express";

export default (item: any, request: Request) => {
  return {
    ...item,
    fullname: `${item.name || ""} ${item.surname || ""}`.trim(),
  };
};
```
