# Upgrading to 0.30.0

This version contains some major and breaking changes. You can easily upgrade your project by using this documentation.

## Step 1. Serialization folder

Axe API will not support model `serialize` method anymore with this version.

You should create a `Serialization` folder under the `app` directory instead of that model function.

#### Before

```ts
class User extends Model {
  serialize(item: any, request: Request) {
    return {
      ...item,
      fullname: `${item.name} ${item.surname}`,
    };
  }
}
```

#### After

```ts
class User extends Model {
  // no serialize method anymore
}
```

`app/Serialization/UserSerialization.ts`

```ts
import { Request } from "express";

export default (item: any, request: Request) => {
  return {
    ...item,
    fullname: `${item.name || ""} ${item.surname || ""}`.trim(),
  };
};
```

## Step 2. Setup version folder

All of your application files should be in a version folder with the new version. Your files should be looking like the following example before `0.30.0`;

```bash
├── app
  ├── Config
  ├── Events
  ├── Hooks
  ├── Models
  ├── init.ts
```

Your `app` folder structure should be changed like this;

```bash
├── app
  ├── v1
    ├── Config
    ├── Events
    ├── Hooks
    ├── Models
    ├── init.ts
```

:::tip
You can use any version name such as `v1`, `v2`, `beta`, etc.
:::

## Step 3. Setup application config

Your API should have two different configurations;

- Application config (`/app/config.ts`)
- Version config (`/app/v1/config.ts`)

:::tip
The main configuration file has been split into two different parts because both applications and versions should have different configuration files to configure the application and version separately.
:::

You can see the application configuration file content in the following example;

`app/config.ts`

```ts
import path from "path";
import { LogLevels, IApplicationConfig } from "axe-api";

const config: IApplicationConfig = {
  prefix: "api",
  env: process.env.NODE_ENV || "production",
  port: process.env.APP_PORT ? parseInt(process.env.APP_PORT) : 3000,
  logLevel: LogLevels.INFO,
  database: {
    client: process.env.DB_CLIENT || "mysql",
    connection: {
      host: process.env.DB_HOST || "localhost",
      user: process.env.DB_USER || "user",
      password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || "password",
      database: process.env.DB_DATABASE || "database",
      filename: path.join(__dirname, "..", "..", "mydb.sqlite"),
    },
    pool: {
      min: 2,
      max: 10,
    },
    migrations: {
      tableName: "knex_migrations",
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

## Step 4. Setup version config

Each of your API versions should have a configuration file like the following example;

`app/v1/config.ts`

```ts
import { IVersionConfig } from "axe-api";

const config: IVersionConfig = {
  transaction: [],
  serializers: [],
  supportedLanguages: ["en-GB", "en", "tr", "de"],
  defaultLanguage: "en-GB",
};

export default config;
```

## Step 4. Remove old configuration folder

The `app/Config` folder should be removed. All configurations in that folder should be moved to the `app/config.ts` and `app/v1/config.ts` files.
